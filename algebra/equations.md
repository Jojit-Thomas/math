# Equations in Algebra

## Linear Equations
### One-step Equations
Example: x + 5 = 12
Solution:
1. Subtract 5 from both sides
2. x = 7

### Two-step Equations
Example: 2x + 3 = 11
Solution:
1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4

- Multi-step equations
- Word problems

## Quadratic Equations
- Standard form
### Factoring Method
Example: x² + 5x + 6 = 0
Solution:
1. Factor: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
2. Set each factor to zero: x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0
3. Solve: x = -2 or x = -3

### Quadratic Formula
For ax² + bx + c = 0
x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] ÷ (2a)

Example: x² + 2x - 3 = 0
1. a = 1, b = 2, c = -3
2. x = [-2 ± √(4 - 4(1)(-3))] ÷ 2
3. x = -3 or 1

- Completing the square

## Real-Life Applications
### Age Problems
Problem: Tom is 3 times as old as his son. In 4 years, he will be twice as old. How old are they now?

Let x = son's age
- Tom's age = 3x
- In 4 years: 3x + 4 = 2(x + 4)
- Solve: 3x + 4 = 2x + 8
- x = 4
- Therefore: Son is 4, Tom is 12
