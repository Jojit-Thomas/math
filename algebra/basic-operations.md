# Comprehensive Guide to Algebraic Operations

## Fundamental Operations

### Addition and Subtraction
- Combining like terms
  - Simple: 2x + 3x = 5x
  - Complex: (2x² + 3x - 4) + (5x² - 2x + 1) = 7x² + x - 3
- Special cases
  - Adding/subtracting negatives: 3x - (-2x) = 5x
  - Zero property: a + 0 = a
  - Additive inverse: a + (-a) = 0

### Multiplication and Division
- Basic operations
  - Monomials: (3x)(2x) = 6x²
  - Polynomials: (2x + 1)(x - 3) = 2x² - 6x + x - 3 = 2x² - 5x - 3
- Advanced concepts
  - Perfect square trinomials: (x + a)² = x² + 2ax + a²
  - Difference of squares: a² - b² = (a+b)(a-b)
- Division rules
  - Polynomial division: (6x³ + 3x² - 9x) ÷ 3x = 2x² + x - 3
  - Rational expressions: (x² + 3x)/(x) = x + 3

## Properties Deep Dive

### Commutative Property
> The order of the operands doesn't matter when adding or multiplying.
- Addition: a + b = b + a
- Multiplication: a × b = b × a
- Counter-example: Matrix multiplication is not commutative
- Examples:
  - 5 × 3 = 3 × 5
  - xy = yx
  - 3ab = ab3

### Associative Property
> When grouping three or more numbers, the way you group them doesn't affect the result.
- Addition: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
- Multiplication: (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
- Complex examples:
  - (2x + 3) + 4x = 2x + (3 + 4x) = 6x + 3
  - (2 × 3) × 4 = 2 × (3 × 4) = 24

### Distributive Property
> Multiplying a number by a sum is the same as multiplying each addend by the number and then adding the products.
- Simple: a(b + c) = ab + ac
- Double distribution: (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd
- Complex examples:
  - 3(2x + 4) = 6x + 12
  - (x + 2)(x - 3) = x² - 3x + 2x - 6 = x² - x - 6
  - 2(x² + 3x - 1) = 2x² + 6x - 2

### Identity Properties
> Special numbers that, when combined with other numbers using certain operations, leave those numbers unchanged.
- Additive identity: a + 0 = a (0 is the additive identity)
- Multiplicative identity: a × 1 = a (1 is the multiplicative identity)
- Examples with variables:
  - 5x + 0 = 5x
  - 1 × 3ab = 3ab

### Inverse Properties
> Every number has an opposite (additive inverse) and a reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) that combine to give the identity.
- Additive inverse: a + (-a) = 0
- Multiplicative inverse: a × (1/a) = 1 (a ≠ 0)
- Applications:
  - Solving equations: x + 5 = 8 → add -5 to both sides
  - Reciprocals: 2 × (1/2) = 1

## Advanced Order of Operations
1. Parentheses, Brackets, Braces
   - Inside out: {[2 × (3 + 4)] - 5} = {[2 × 7] - 5} = {14 - 5} = 9
2. Exponents and Roots
   - √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5
3. Multiplication and Division
   - 12 ÷ 3 × 4 = 4 × 4 = 16
4. Addition and Subtraction
   - Complex example: 2x + 3(x - 4) - 5x² = -5x² + 2x + 3x - 12 = -5x² + 5x - 12

## Special Products and Factoring
### Special Products
- (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
- (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²
- (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²
- (x + a)(x + b) = x² + (a+b)x + ab

### Common Factoring Techniques
1. Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
   - 6x³y + 12x²y² = 6x²y(x + 2y)
2. Grouping
   - ac + ad + bc + bd = a(c + d) + b(c + d) = (a + b)(c + d)
3. Perfect Square Trinomials
   - x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²
4. Difference of Squares
   - 16x² - 25 = (4x + 5)(4x - 5)
